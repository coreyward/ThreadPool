Version 0.3
- First commit to git and github.
- We have 
  - a ThreadPool class which has a single queue and a store
    of threads that contend for jobs stored on the queue.
  - SyncQueue class which represents a single thread
    and single queue where the jobs are executed synchronously.
  - we can decrement or increment the threads on an instance
    of ThreadPool.
